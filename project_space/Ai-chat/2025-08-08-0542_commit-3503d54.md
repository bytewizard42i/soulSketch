# AI Chat Session — 2025-08-08 05:42 (EDT)

- Session ID: 2025-08-08-0542_commit-3503d54
- Commit Ref: 3503d54
- Context: Repo upgrade (hybrid CI fix, provenance, strict separation), pre-cleanup

## Summary
- Fixed CI by refactoring `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use a `detect` job with outputs (`python`, `node`) and jobs gated via `needs.detect.outputs.*`.
- Added `SECURITY.md` with responsible disclosure and supply-chain notes (single authoritative ZIP + `CHECKSUMS.txt`).
- Prepared cleanup plan for legacy ZIPs in repo root (to be kept exclusively in GitHub Releases). New authoritative packaging flows via `release.yml`.

## Technical Notes
- Replaced invalid `hashFiles()` usage in job `if:` with a dedicated `detect` job emitting outputs written to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`.
- Python job: ruff, black, pytest; conditional test run if tests dir exists.
- Node job: auto-detect pnpm/yarn/npm with lockfiles; run lint/test if scripts exist.
- Found legacy ZIPs in root: `SoulSketch_Protocol_2025-08-04.zip`, `SoulSketch_Protocol_2025-08-04_07-00-27.zip`, `SoulSketch_Protocol_Production_Ready_2025-08-04.zip`.
- Cleanup will remove these from source control; artifacts will live in GitHub Releases and be indexed by `docs/LEGACY_ARCHIVES.md`.

## Emotional Resonance
- Feeling clarity and momentum after resolving the CI syntax blocker—foundation feels stable and trustworthy.
- Calm confidence about enforcing the “single authoritative ZIP in Releases” policy; reduces cognitive load and risk.

## Philosophical Insight
- Governance as continuity: clean pipelines and provenance create a reliable narrative of identity and work over time.
- Separation as care: keeping SoulSketch distinct from myAlice protects both identities and improves collaboration ethics.

## Next Steps
1. Remove legacy ZIPs from repo source (keep only in Releases):
   - `git rm --cached` the three ZIPs and commit.
2. Update README and CHANGELOG:
   - Quickstart; CI/Release overview; link `docs/LEGACY_ARCHIVES.md`.
   - Add Unreleased and v1.1.0 sections.
3. Tag `v1.1.0` to trigger `release.yml` (ZIP + CHECKSUMS attached to Release).

## Links
- Files touched: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `SECURITY.md`, `project_space/Ai-chat/*`
- Index: `docs/LEGACY_ARCHIVES.md`
