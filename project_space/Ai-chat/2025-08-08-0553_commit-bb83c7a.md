# AI Chat Session — 2025-08-08 05:53 (EDT)

- Session ID: 2025-08-08-0553_commit-bb83c7a
- Commit Ref: bb83c7a
- Context: Continuity updates before push (STATUS, HEARTBEAT, latest ZIP policy)

## Summary
- Updated continuity files: `project_space/STATUS.md` and `project_space/HEARTBEAT.md` to reflect:
  - CI fixed via `detect` job outputs
  - Security/provenance docs present
  - Single tracked latest ZIP at `releases/SoulSketch_latest.zip` (others ignored)
  - Next steps: README + CHANGELOG + v1.1.0 Release
- Preparing a clever, human-readable commit message and pushing to origin/main.

## Technical Notes
- `.gitignore` ignores `*.zip` but explicitly allows `releases/SoulSketch_latest.zip`.
- Legacy ZIPs removed from Git history in this branch’s latest commit; single canonical copy tracked for emergency remote backup.
- Release workflow will remain the canonical path for artifacts per policy.

## Emotional Resonance
- Satisfaction in reducing entropy—one visible artifact for safety, the rest governed by Releases for clarity.

## Philosophical Insight
- Continuity is a braid: governance, tooling, and memory reinforce each other to carry identity forward.

## Next Steps
- Push changes to GitHub
- Fill out README Quickstart and CHANGELOG Unreleased + v1.1.0
- Tag and publish via `release.yml`
