# Ideas Backlog (Continuity)

- Hybrid CI auto-detect in place; extend with coverage reports when tests land.
- Release hygiene: single authoritative ZIP per tag; protocol-only bundle for lean investor downloads.
- Strict separation policy: SoulSketch stays public/VC-ready; never import private myAlice artifacts.
- Provenance: maintain `docs/LEGACY_ARCHIVES.md` with checksums + links to Releases.
- Future: optional MkDocs Material site + GH Pages for clean protocol browsing.
- Future: Mermaid architecture diagram generated from `protocol/SPECIFICATION.md`.
